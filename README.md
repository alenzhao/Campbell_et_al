# 23andMe Genetic Maps

This folder contains the recombination rates derived from 4,209 families, as described in the manuscript, [Campbell <i>et al</i>., Nature Communications, 6, 6260 (2015)](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150219/ncomms7260/full/ncomms7260.html). 
<br><br>The tarball contains sex specific maps and sex-averaged maps. Coordinates are in human genome build 37. Also included are a set of recombination hotspots from [HapMap](http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads/recombination/) that have been lifted to build 37.
